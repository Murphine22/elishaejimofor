---

## 🔧 Modified Files

### `/components/chatbot.tsx`
**Changes Made**:
1. ✅ Updated `handleSubmit` function to be async
2. ✅ Added API call to `/api/chat` endpoint
3. ✅ Implemented error handling with fallback to local responses
4. ✅ Updated initial greeting message to mention Gemini AI
5. ✅ Changed badge from "AI Powered" to "Powered by Gemini AI"
6. ✅ Maintained conversation history for context

**Fallback System**:
If the Gemini API fails (network issues, rate limits, etc.), the chatbot automatically uses the original local response system, ensuring uninterrupted service.

---

## 🚀 How to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create Environment File
Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAfHlVMNBLB-II5qbd44PKKXfIHWqagL_c
```

**Note**: The API key is also hardcoded as a fallback in the route file, but using environment variables is recommended for security.

### Step 2: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Chatbot
1. Open your website
2. Click the chat icon (bottom-right corner)
3. Try asking questions like:
   - "What skills does Elisha have?"
   - "Tell me about your projects"
   - "What services do you offer?"
   - "How was this website built?"

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before (Local Responses)
- ❌ Limited to predefined responses
- ❌ Pattern matching only
- ❌ No context awareness
- ❌ Repetitive answers

### After (Gemini AI)
- ✅ Natural, intelligent conversations
- ✅ Context-aware responses
- ✅ Maintains conversation history
- ✅ Comprehensive website knowledge
- ✅ Can answer complex questions
- ✅ More engaging user experience
- ✅ Fallback system for reliability

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ Already Implemented
- API key stored in environment variables
- `.env.local` is gitignored (won't be committed)
- Server-side API calls (key never exposed to client)
- Error handling prevents key leakage

### 📝 Best Practices
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Monitor API usage in Google AI Studio
- Use environment variables in production

---

- **Model**: `gemini-pro`
- **Best for**: Text-based conversations
